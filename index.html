            <h1> <span> Great Computer Programming Quote’s in the World</span></h1>
            <p>
                “People always fear change. People feared electricity when it was invented, didn’t they? <br> People
                feared
                coal, they feared gas-powered engines. There will always be ignorance, and ignorance leads to fear. But
                with
                time, people will come to accept their silicon masters.”

                As Bill Gates once warned, computers have indeed become our silicon masters, pervading nearly every
                aspect
                of our modern lives.<br> As a result, some of the greatest minds of our time have pondered the
                significance
                of computers and software on the human condition.<br> Following are 101 great quotes about computers,
                with
                an emphasis on programming, since after all this is a software development site.

            <h2>Computers </h2>
            <p>
                “Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.”
                (Pablo Picasso)
                <br> <br>
                “Computers are like bikinis. They save people a lot of guesswork.”
                (Sam Ewing)
                <br> <br>
                “They have computers, and they may have other weapons of mass destruction.”
                (Janet Reno)
                <br> <br>
                “That’s what’s cool about working with computers. They don’t argue, they remember everything, and they
                don’t
                drink all your beer.”
                (Paul Leary)
                <br> <br>
                “If the automobile had followed the same development cycle as the computer, a Rolls-Royce would today
                cost
                $100,<br> get a million miles per gallon, and explode once a year, killing everyone inside.”

            <h2> Computer Intelligence and its working</h2>
            <p><br>
                “Computers are getting smarter all the time. Scientists tell us that soon they will be able to talk to
                us.
                <br> (And by ‘they’, I mean ‘computers’. I doubt scientists will ever be able to talk to us.)”
                (Dave Barry)
                <br><br>
                “I’ve noticed lately that the paranoid fear of computers becoming intelligent and taking over the world
                has
                almost<br> entirely disappeared from the common culture. Near as I can tell, this coincides with the
                release
                of MS-DOS.”
                (Larry DeLuca)
                <br><br>
                “The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim.”
                (Edsger W. Dijkstra)
                <br><br>
                “It’s ridiculous to live 100 years and only be able to remember 30 million bytes. <br> You know, less
                than a
                compact disc. The human condition is really becoming more obsolete every minute.”

            <h2>Software Patents</h2>
            <p>
                “The bulk of all patents are crap. Spending time reading them is stupid. It’s up to the patent owner to
                do
                so, and to enforce them.”

            <br><br>
            <p>
                “Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.”
                (Brian Kernigan)
                <br><br>
                “Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and
                test,
                it introduces security challenges,<br> and it causes end-user and administrator frustration.”
                (Ray Ozzie)
                <br><br>
                “There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are
                obviously no deficiencies.<br> And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious
                deficiencies.”
                (C.A.R. Hoare)
                <br><br>
                “The function of good software is to make the complex appear to be simple.”

            <br><br>
            “Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each
            other,<br> with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.”
            (Alan Kay)
            <br><br>
            “I’ve finally learned what ‘upward compatible’ means. It means we get to keep all our old mistakes.”

                “Come to think of it, there are already a million monkeys on a million typewriters, and Usenet is

                “The most amazing achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation<br> of
                the
                steady and staggering gains made by the computer hardware industry.”
                (Henry Petroski)
                <br><br>
                “True innovation often comes from the small startup who is lean enough to launch a market but lacks the
                heft
                to own it.”
                (Timm Martin)
                <br><br>
                “It has been said that the great scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on the shoulders
                of
                other giants.<br> It has also been said that the software industry is an example of midgets standing on
                the
                toes of other midgets.”
                (Alan Cooper)
